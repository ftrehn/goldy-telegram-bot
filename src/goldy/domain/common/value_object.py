    Rejections are logged here rather than in each subclass. A value object
    refusing a value is how bad input is turned away, and it happens in the
    middle of a use case where the caller only sees the raised error — one line
    at the point of refusal says which value object rejected what, for every one
    of them, without a log call in forty files.

    Debug level because rejection is ordinary traffic: a malformed phone number
    is someone fat-fingering the keyboard, not an incident.
