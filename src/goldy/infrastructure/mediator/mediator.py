    """Dispatches a request to its handler through the registered pipelines.

    Handlers and pipelines are resolved per request rather than held as
    instances: they depend on request-scoped things — the session, the events
    collection — so a cached handler would serve one request's state to the
    next.

    Only ``send`` is implemented. Domain events do not travel through an
    in-process notification bus here; they go to the outbox and reach their
    consumers as background tasks, which is what makes them survive a crash
    between the state change and its projection.
